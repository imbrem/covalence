## 1. Signature → Theory → Model

The three first-class objects, made precise:

```
   Logic       a LANGUAGE (typed grammar / type theory — what can be STATED) PLUS
               derivability rules (what can be PROVED), BUNDLED as one object
               (e.g. classical FOL, intuitionistic FOL — two logics over the SAME
                language, related by a language-ISO, not a shared-identity syntax)
   Signature   type constants + TYPE FAMILIES (with KINDS: ty, ty→ty, ty→ty→ty, …)
               + operation symbols, typed over that type part — in a logic's language
   Specification   the laws / axioms over the signature (formulas in the language)
   Theory      = Signature + Specification
   Model       interprets the SIGNATURE's symbols as objects — an interpretation of
               the language (pure semantics; no axioms); models related by ISO-TRANSPORT
   M ⊨ T       "M is a model of theory T": a PROOF, in a LOGIC, that M's
               interpretation satisfies T's spec
```

**A logic bundles its language and its rules — kept as *internal aspects of one
object*, deliberately *not* two separately-shared ones.** Conceptually a logic
has two parts: a *language* (the typed grammar — terms/formulas/kinds — what can
be *stated*; logicians' "language", `admits` below is its well-typedness
judgment) and a *derivability relation* (the rules — what can be *proved*).
Intuitionistic and classical FOL share a language and differ only in `⊢`. **But
we do *not* reify the language as a separate object that logics reference by
identity** — "do `L₁` and `L₂` have *the same* language?" asked as an *equality*
distinguishes isomorphic languages and is **evil** (non-invariant), cutting
against this doc's own "always reach for isomorphic models". So: language + rules
**bundle into the `Logic` object**, and "these two logics share a language" is a
*language-isomorphism* (a morphism up to iso — for int/classical FOL, the identity
translation plus the `LEM` extension), never an identity. **A model interprets a
logic's language** (semantics, indifferent to the rules) and models relate by
**iso-transport**; **`M ⊨ T` is proved in a logic** (which logic is part of the
claim — a Heyting-valued `M` satisfies the intuitionistic `T`, a Boolean one the
classical `T`). This is still the Isabelle/Pure shape — a substrate logic (HOL-ω,
Pure's typed λ-calculus with `≡`) carrying object logics (FOL/PA/…) that add `⊢` —
just without an evil shared-syntax identity between them.

The decisive feature: **the signature is higher-kinded.** A signature *opens*
with its type part — type constants of kind `ty`, and **type families** of kind
`ty → ty`, `ty → ty → ty`, … — and only then gives the operations typed over it.

- **Group / Monoid / Ordered field**: type part is a *carrier* of kind `ty`
  (`α : ty`), then `op : α→α→α`, `e : α`, …
- **Monad**: type part opens with a *family* `m : ty → ty`, then
  `return : a → m a`, `bind : m a → (a → m b) → m b`.
- **Profunctor**: `p : ty → ty → ty`, then `dimap`.

A **theory** adds the spec (associativity/identities for monoid; the monad laws;
Spivak's 13 axioms for a complete ordered field). A **model** realizes the
signature's vocabulary as concrete objects in a host — that realization is an
interpretation of the *syntax*, and is pure semantics (it does not yet mention
the spec). The claim that those objects *satisfy the spec* is then a separate
proof, `M ⊨ T`, carried out in a *logic* over the syntax (§1.1). Not every
signature is statable in every syntax, and not every spec is provable in every
logic over it (§3 — the two-axis consumability).

This is the **ML module system / typeclass** concept, made first-class *with
proved morphisms*: signature ≈ a *signature*/*class*, model ≈ a
*structure*/*instance*, a definition or proof written against the theory ≈ a
*functor* (parametric in the model).

### 1.1 Two seams: `Logic` (language + rules, bundled) and `Model` (interpretation)

The single `Logic` object bundles its language and its derivability rules (§1 —
splitting them into a separately-*shared* syntax object would be evil). A `Model`
is separate, because a model is a genuinely different kind of thing — a structure,
related to logics by `⊨` and to other models by iso-transport, never quotiented
by identity. So **two** seams, not three:

- **`Logic` = language + rules.** `admits` is the *language* aspect (statability,
  §3.1 — does its grammar's kinds reach this signature? FOL *refuses* a `ty→ty`
  family). `handlers` is the *rules* aspect (the proof-side dispatch — rewriting,
  induction, reduction, LEM-or-not — genuinely *varied per logic*). These are two
  *aspects of one object*; "same language" across logics is a morphism up to iso,
  not a field they share.
- **`Model` = meaning.** An interpretation of a logic's *language*: it realizes
  each signature symbol as a concrete object and lowers surface literals into its
  carrier. Pure semantics — says nothing about axioms.

```rust
/// LOGIC — bundles a LANGUAGE (a type theory: what can be STATED) and DERIVABILITY
/// rules (what can be PROVED) as ONE object. Language + rules are internal aspects,
/// NOT two shared objects — "same language?" by identity would be evil.
trait Logic {
    fn admits(&self, sig: &Signature) -> Result<(), Unstatable>;   // language aspect (§3.1)
    fn handlers(&self) -> HandlerSet;                              // rules aspect (per logic)
    /// Literal POLICY (not realization): which literal kinds this logic admits
    /// and at what target sort. `None` = this logic has no such literal. The
    /// model (below) realizes an admitted literal into its carrier. (`nat`
    /// literal = a non-negative `int` literal — one entry.)
    fn literal_sort(&self, kind: LiteralKind) -> Option<Sort>;     // language aspect
}

/// MODEL — interprets a signature's symbols as objects (semantics; no axioms);
/// models relate to each other by ISO-TRANSPORT. Literal-lifting is the model
/// realizing surface literals into its carrier.
trait Model {
    fn interpret(&self, sig: &Signature) -> Result<Interpretation, …>;
    /// --- LITERAL LIFTING (model-relative; each may FAIL) ---
    /// A surface literal is lowered into THIS model's carrier — and a model may
    /// legitimately reject a kind (Err). A Nat literal is a non-negative Int one.
    fn lift_int(&self, n: &Int)    -> Result<Term, NoLiteral>;
    fn lift_string(&self, s: &str) -> Result<Term, NoLiteral>;
    fn lift_bytes(&self, b: &[u8]) -> Result<Term, NoLiteral>;
}
```

A **model** is `(a Model interpretation over a Logic's language)` alone — *not*
the satisfaction proof. **`M ⊨ T`** is a separate object: a proof, **in a
`Logic`**, that `M`'s interpretation satisfies `T`'s spec (`surface-compiler.md
§3.0.2`; it is a `.thm`, and which logic it's proved in is part of the claim). So
the seams collaborate as: `Logic` gates *statability* and supplies *proof power*,
`Model` supplies *meaning*, and `M ⊨ T` is the theorem that ties a model to a
theory. (This is what Track 1 built: its `Logic` bundles `nat_model()` =
interpret + handlers, with no separate syntax object.)

**Literal lifting is a `Model` method — model-relative and fallible.** The
surface literal `3` is not one fixed kernel term; the *model* decides how to lower
it into its carrier (`surface-compiler.md §5`). The *logic* only fixes the
**policy** — whether the literal is admitted and at what target *sort*
(`literal_sort` above) — while the **model** fixes the *value* (the carrier term);
two models of one theory in one logic lower `3` differently
(`surface-compiler.md §3.0.5`). For `nat/self` (kernel `nat`)
`lift_int(3)` is the built-in literal; for **`nat/unary`** (`list unit`) it runs a
model-supplied **builtin-nat → unary conversion** (`3 ↦ cons unit.nil (cons
unit.nil (cons unit.nil nil))`); for a reified-SOA model it is the object numeral
`S(S(S 0))`. A model with no sensible lift returns `Err(NoLiteral)` — a
diagnostic, not a silent coercion. (A **Nat** literal is exactly a non-negative
**Int** literal, so there is a single `lift_int`; string/byte are the same shape.)
This is the `covalence-pure` literal-as-lifted-observation mechanism
(`covalence-pure.md §3`) surfaced as a `Model` responsibility. This
`Logic`+`Model` two-seam split is the Rust-level realization of the
logic/theory/model architecture, and the substrate the HOL-ω migration slots into
(HOL-ω is a new `Logic` whose bundled language has a richer `admits`, *reusing*
the existing `Model` seam).

---

## 2. Many models of one theory **within one logic** (the primary concept)

The point is **not** merely "different logics give different models." It is that
**one theory has many genuinely different *implementations* inside a *single*
logic** — and that within-logic multiplicity is first-class.

Within HOL *alone*:

- **`Nat`** — the kernel `nat`; `list unit` (unary); a `bool`-stream coding; the
  `nat` obtained by interpreting SOA's number sort.
- **`CompleteOrderedField`** — Dedekind cuts; Cauchy sequences of rationals; the
  SOA-coded reals interpreted into HOL.
- **`Monoid`** — `(nat,+,0)`, `(nat,×,1)`, `(α→α, ∘, id)` — *already built*, three
  models of one interface inside HOL.

So a theory's unit of organization is **theory (interface) + {models} +
{morphisms between models}**, where each model is a *distinct implementation*
(carrier + ops + axiom-satisfaction proof). Library content (definitions, proofs)
is written **against the theory** and **instantiated at any model**.

### 2.1 The morphisms — and reaching for isomorphic models

Models of a theory are related by **proved morphisms**; the strongest is an
**isomorphism**, which transports facts losslessly both ways. The dispatcher
keeps a *family* of in-logic models and **routes each operation to the cheapest
isomorphic representative** (`surface-compiler.md §4`): prove a fact in whichever
of `nat ≅ list unit` is easier, transport over the iso, it holds in both.

### 2.2 The unification: acceleration *is* an in-logic iso

The **efficient `nat`** (the kernel accelerator) and the **defined `nat`** are
*two models of `Nat` within HOL*, and the proof they are isomorphic **is**
`discharge(NatAccel)` from `covalence-pure.md §4.2`. So three things we designed
separately collapse into one mechanism:

> within-logic model multiplicity ≡ isomorphic-model dispatch ≡
> accelerator-soundness (the accelerator and the definition are two models + a
> proved iso).

"The accelerator coincides with its definition" is literally "here are two
models of `Nat` in one logic and an iso between them."

---

## 3. Consumability — when can a logic host a theory?

A logic `L` hosts a theory `(Σ, Φ)` only if it clears **two independent axes.**

### 3.1 Statability — can `L` *express* `Σ`'s kinds and `Φ`'s order?

| Logic | Type part it can express | Spec order |
|---|---|---|
| **FOL** | type *constants* only (kind `ty`) | first-order |
| **HOL (rank-1)** | + kind-`ty` type *variables* (polymorphism) | + higher-order |
| **HOL-ω** | + higher-kinded type *families* (`ty→ty`, …) | + higher-order |

### 3.2 Provability — is `L` *strong enough* to prove a model satisfies `Φ`?

This is the reverse-math / subsystem axis: `RCA₀ ⊂ WKL₀ ⊂ ACA₀ ⊂ … ⊂ HOL`. A
theory can be *statable* in a weak logic yet a model's satisfaction *unprovable*
there — which is exactly the analysis-in-SOA content (§5).

**The two axes are independent.** HOL-ω is about axis 1 (kinds); the
SOA-subsystem ladder is about axis 2 (strength). A logic "can't consume" a theory
either because it can't *state* it (wrong kinds/order) or can't *prove* a model
into it (too weak).

### 3.3 The polymorphism boundary (the rank-1 HOL nuance)

"HOL can host some higher-kinded cases via polymorphism" — the precise line:

- **Rank-1 HOL hosts a *generic* theory exactly when the type part is kind-`ty`
  (a carrier variable).** Monoid's `(α:ty, op, e)` → `∀'a. …` is a genuine HOL
  theorem. Models are instantiations at concrete `'a` + ops. No HOL-ω needed —
  Monoid/Group/Ring/OrderedField/vector-space-over-a-fixed-field all qualify.
- **Rank-1 HOL *cannot* host a generic theory with a kind-`ty→ty` family**
  (Monad's `m`, Functor's `f`): you can't write `∀m:ty→ty. …`. Fallbacks:
  - **per-instance** — fix `m := option`; the monad laws *for option* are a fine
    rank-1 development (each monad separate — "one ground instance at a time");
  - **meta-level** — do the genericity in Rust (our `Monoid` value carrying the
    laws), quantifying at the meta-level and sidestepping the object logic.
- **The line is "must you quantify over the constructor?"** If constructors are
  *concrete* and only the *element* type varies, rank-1 suffices —
  `∀'a. F 'a → G 'a` (a natural transformation between *fixed* `F`, `G`) is a
  good rank-1 type. You need HOL-ω precisely when the constructor itself is a
  *variable you bind*.

**Consequence.** Monad / functor / profunctor *genericity in the object logic* is
the thing genuinely blocked on HOL-ω — the concrete "theory we care about that is
unstatable in rank-1" that `metatheory.md §5.2` named as the adoption trigger.
Everything on the *current* roadmap (Monoid, Ring, the 13 axioms / analysis, the
SOA program) is kind-`ty`, so rank-1 hosts it generically; HOL-ω earns its place
when a generic Monad development becomes load-bearing.

## 4. The `.thy` / `.cov` shape

Splitting a theory's authoring along this architecture:

```
   real.thy            the SIGNATURE + SPEC (surface syntax) — the interface.
                       For `real`: Spivak's 13 complete-ordered-field axioms.
   real/cuts.cov       a MODEL in HOL: Dedekind cuts + the 13-axiom proof.
   real/cauchy.cov     a MODEL in HOL: Cauchy sequences + the 13-axiom proof.
   real/soa.cov        a MODEL via SOA-coded reals + the 13-axiom proof.
   analysis/…          library content written AGAINST real.thy, INSTANTIABLE
                       at any model above.
```

- The **header** (`.thy`) is surface syntax (`surface-syntax.md`); it needs the
  surface elaborator (not yet built — agent-landed inline `#def`/`#newtype`/
  `#subtype`/`#quot` in the `.cov` language is the precursor). **Don't block the
  content on the header ergonomics**: today the **givens-env** (`*_env()`
  exposing operators + axioms as givens) *is* the interface object; the `.thy`
  surface header is sugar over it, layered on later.
- "Share proofs across models" = proofs are *functors* over the theory; each
  model supplies its implementation + satisfaction proof; the library replays
  against any model. The replay *failures* (a proof that won't go through in a
  weaker model) are as informative as the successes — that's the reverse-math
  signal.

---

## 5. The driving programs: the analysis library + the reified-theory ladder

The concrete first library. Goal: develop (a useful fragment of) Spivak's
*Calculus* and see **how much replays in second-order arithmetic (Z₂)** — i.e.
reverse mathematics, with model-dispatch as the mechanism.

### 5.1 The interface — Spivak's 13 axioms

`real.thy` = the **13 axioms** (P1–P9 field; P10–P12 ordered field via the
positive cone; P13 completeness/LUB). Analysis is developed *against this
interface* — Spivak's own method ("assume P1–P13, derive the rest"), which is the
spec-vs-model structure of `surface-syntax.md §2`. Status of the 13 over the
Dedekind model: P1–P5,P8,P9 proved; P6 (`1≠0`); **P7 (`mul_inv`)** and the order
axioms being discharged now (the rat-postulate work); **P13** is the genuinely
ℝ-specific one (P1–P12 hold of `rat` too).

### 5.2 The tree (a DAG of `.cov` files — the first `compile_project` target)

```
analysis/
  field.cov        P1–P9   field consequences          ← ring/AC normalizer (built)
  order.cov        P10–P12 inequalities, |·|, sgn       ← order / SMT (Farkas seed)
  complete.cov     P13     sup/inf, Archimedean, density
  sequences.cov    Cauchy, monotone convergence
  limits.cov       ε–δ limits, limit laws
  continuity.cov   IVT / EVT / boundedness (needs P13)
  derivative.cov   rules, chain rule, MVT              ← symbolic differentiator (phase 2)
  integral.cov     Riemann integral, FTC               ← symbolic integrator (phase 2)
  elementary.cov   exp / log / trig
```

This is a DAG of mutually-aware `.cov` files — exactly what the landed
`compile_project` (`docs/cov-project.md`) builds, replacing the hand-written
`library_env` wiring. **First milestone: chapters 1–8** (axioms → completeness →
continuity → the three hard theorems); derivatives/integrals are **phase 2**.

### 5.3 Three automation layers (handlers, in the effect-system sense)

1. **Algebraic identities** → the **ring/AC normalizer** (`ac.rs`,
   `ring/normalize.rs` — built).
2. **Inequalities** → **order / SMT**. The Alethe **Farkas/`la_generic`**
   prototype is the seed; generalize to n-literal QF_LRA over `rat`/`real`.
3. **Calculus** → a **proof-producing symbolic differentiator** (a rewriter
   `f ↦ ⊢ deriv f = f'` over the proved rules), later an integrator.

### 5.4 The reified-object-theory ladder (prop → PA → SOA, and beyond)

> **Revised sequencing (user):** don't jump straight to SOA. Climb the ladder —
> **propositional logic → Peano arithmetic → second-order arithmetic** — building
> reusable *first-order-logic and theory* tooling at each rung. Each rung is the
> same recipe (`init/prop.rs`): reify the syntax as a datatype → an inductive
> `Derivable_X` predicate → a denotation `⟦·⟧` into HOL → **soundness proved
> internally** → the transport morphism. **Induction on derivations** (rule
> induction, the impredicative `inst d := P`) is the through-line skill.

**Rung 1 — propositional logic.** Already reified + proved sound (`init/prop.rs`);
the near-term work is `prop.cov` exposing it in the script language, with
**induction-on-derivations packaged as a first-class principle** — and a
deliberate *stress test* of the `.cov` language over reified syntax (the surface
gaps it surfaces drive the next language features). This is the cheapest place to
nail the metatheory loop end-to-end.

**Rung 2 — Peano arithmetic, and FOL tooling in general.** PA = first-order logic
(terms, formulas, capture-avoiding substitution, ∀/∃) + the arithmetic signature +
the **induction schema**; soundness via HOL `nat`. This is the big reusable
investment: a generic **first-order-theory framework** (the syntax of FOL, a
`Derivable` engine parameterized by a signature + axioms, the denotation
machinery) that *every* later theory reuses. **Knowing a result is PA-provable is
itself a useful certificate** — a large fraction of mathematics lives in PA, and
PA-provability bounds a theorem's logical strength. The FOL framework is what
rung 1's stress-test gaps tell us to build.

**Rung 3 — second-order arithmetic (Z₂).** Multi-sorted (number + set vars),
`Derivable_SOA` (PA⁻ + second-order induction + comprehension), denotation
(numbers→`nat`, sets→`nat→bool`). **HOL models Z₂ cleanly** (full comprehension =
HOL λ-abstraction), so soundness is direct *and* the denotation **is** the
SOA→HOL transport interpretation. Then the showpiece: reify HOL in HOL
(hol-in-hol), prove `SOA(A) ⟹ HOL(A)` between the two *reified* theories, and
**transport** an SOA theorem to internal-HOL rather than re-prove it — first-class
metatheory made visible. Reify **full Z₂ first**; the RCA₀/ACA₀ subsystem
stratification (the real reverse-math content, and the home of analysis-in-SOA,
§5.2/Phase 5) is a *refinement* layered on after.

**Other first-order theories worth building** (each a `Derivable_X` + soundness +
transport over the FOL framework from rung 2):

| Theory | What it is | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Robinson Q** | PA minus induction (finitely axiomatized) | the base of essential undecidability / Gödel; the weakest "arithmetic" |
| **Presburger** | FO theory of `(ℕ, +)` | **decidable** (a real decision procedure to build — a handler) |
| **Tarski RCF** | real-closed fields (FO theory of `(ℝ, +, ·, <)`) | **decidable** by quantifier elimination — the decision procedure behind real-algebra automation; pairs with the analysis/SMT layer (§5.3) |
| **ZF / ZFC** | first-order set theory | the long-horizon big goal — the foundational target the metatheory ladder climbs toward |

The decidable ones (Presburger, RCF) are doubly valuable: they're object theories
*and* they yield **decision-procedure handlers** the surface can dispatch to
(`surface-compiler.md` effect dispatch) — the same way the Farkas/Alethe work
yields a linear-arithmetic handler.

**Near-term commitment:** rung 1 (`prop.cov` + induction-on-derivations, in
progress), then the FOL framework + PA (rung 2). SOA, the FO-theory catalogue, and
analysis-in-SOA follow once the FOL tooling is solid.

---

## 6. What's already built that feeds this

- `compile_project` (`docs/cov-project.md`) — the multi-file `.cov` DAG builder
  (`analysis/`'s build path).
- Inline `.cov` definitions (`#def`/`#newtype`/`#subtype`/`#quot`) + the
  equivalence test vs core's parser — the precursor to `.thy` headers.
- `sexp` (tree-based, polymorphic Lisp cons-cell) — the recommended substrate for
  reifying object-language syntax (over the list-based `sexpr`).
- `ring/normalize.rs` + `ac.rs` (algebra) and the Alethe Farkas prototype (SMT) —
  two of the three automation layers, seeded.
- `init/prop.rs` — propositional logic reified + **proved sound internally**: the
  working prototype the SOA reification scales up.
- The ≥2-rec-arg inductive engine + `tree`/`sexp` — substrate for reified syntax.
- The `order`/`preorder` and `monoid` model-generic developments — the first
  in-logic "theory + several models" instances.

---

## 7. Open forks (decisions pending)

1. **Fix the waist — and at HOL Light (rank-1) or HOL-ω?** **RESOLVED:** the
   *final* waist is **HOL-ω** (to program the middle language like Haskell — the
   endgame is a self-bootstrapping HOL-ω→WASM compiler with translation-validated
   soundness); the path is **HOL Light → HOL Light over `covalence-pure` → HOL-ω
   over `covalence-pure`** (HOL-ω is easier to state over the simple Pure base,
   and its API is a superset of HOL Light's so the migration is additive *if*
   `covalence-hol` keeps direct rank-1-polymorphism use concentrated). See
   [`kernel-design.md §11.6`](./kernel-design.md).
2. **Model granularity** — is "acceleration" an *attribute of* a model, or a
   *separate iso-related model*? (Lean: separate model + iso, keeping each model
   clean — consistent with §2.2.)
3. **`real`: fixed-at-the-concrete-type vs parametric `CompleteOrderedField`** —
   lean fixed-at-`real` first (decoupling benefit now), abstract when the surface
   `#theory`/`#model` machinery lands.
4. **SOA: full Z₂ first vs subsystem-stratified from the start** — lean full Z₂
   first; subsystems as a refinement.
5. **First analysis milestone: chapters 1–8 vs pulling derivatives/integrals
   early** (the latter prioritizes the symbolic differentiator sooner).
