//! The `covalence-pure` mint gate for [`Thm`](super::Thm).
//!
//! Every proven HOL sequent `Γ ⊢ φ` is carried as the SINGLE structured pure
//! proposition
//!
//! ```text
//! CoreProp = App<IsThm, (Val<Ctx>, Val<Term>)>
//! ```
//!
//! minted through the fine-grained rule catalogue in `super::rules` in the
//! language [`CoreLang`] (public via [`crate::seam`] since the toHOL slice —
//! the deliberate, one-module-to-audit widening of the core-on-pure seam).
//! `Ctx`/`Term` enter as [`Val`] leaves (O(1)
//! `Arc`-backed wraps — no deep clone, no re-inference), so `App<IsThm, (Val<Ctx>,
//! Val<Term>)>` is an `Expr<Ty = bool>` (the tuple sorts at `(Ctx, Term) =
//! IsThm::In`), satisfying the [`Rule::Concl`] / `Thm<L, P>` bound. It is a
//! STRUCTURED proposition (an [`Op`] over `Val` leaves), not an opaque blob — which
//! keeps the future native-HOL / `NatToHol` embedding seam open (see `SKELETONS.md`).
//!
//! ## Soundness rests on `admits()` ALONE
//!
//! [`CoreLang`] admits exactly the sound `Rule<CoreLang>` ZSTs in
//! `super::rules`, one per HOL inference step. Each rule's `decide` takes its
//! premises as unforgeable `pure::Thm`s and **derives** its conclusion (it never
//! accepts a caller-supplied conclusion), so every firing on any input yields a
//! true theorem. The obtainable set of `pure::Thm<CoreLang, IsThm(Γ,φ)>` therefore
//! contains only genuinely-derivable sequents — the admits-only milestone.
//!
//! Concretely:
//! - `pure::Thm` is unforgeable (private fields, `pub(crate)` `new`; the only mint
//!   for an `IsThm`-headed prop is [`covalence_pure::apply`] gated on an admitted
//!   rule's own `TypeId`).
//! - Novel downstream `impl Rule<CoreLang> for Evil` types are inert:
//!   `core_admits(TypeId::of::<Evil>())` is `false`, so `apply` returns
//!   `NotAdmitted` before `Evil::decide` runs.
//! - [`super::rules::core_admits`] and `super::rules::CORE_MANIFEST` are emitted
//!   from ONE source list by the `core_rules!` macro, so they cannot drift.
//!
//! The inner `pure::Thm` field on [`Thm`](super::Thm) is now **hygiene-only**: it
//! keeps `pure::Thm`/`CoreLang` out of the public signature and preserves
//! `Arc`-identity, but is no longer load-bearing for soundness. What still remains
//! trusted (unchanged, documented seams): the `unfold_term_spec` definitional
//! unfolding and the per-family certificate dispatch (`super::certs` over
//! `covalence-pure-eval`).
