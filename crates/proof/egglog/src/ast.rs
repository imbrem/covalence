//! A small egglog source AST — just enough to drive Fiat-only EUF proofs
//! end-to-end from `.egg` text.
//!
//! Scope deliberately minimal: this is *not* a complete egglog parser. It
//! covers the commands needed to declare a signature, assert ground
//! equalities, and designate a target equality to ingest as a [`Proof`](crate::proof::Proof).
//! Rewrites, datatypes-with-arity, schedules, relations, run/check, etc.
//! all sit outside the scope here — they belong to later Stages.
//!
//! The supported subset is in 1-1 correspondence with what
//! [`EgglogBridge`](crate::EgglogBridge) wires through
//! kernel-checked (i.e. without the `Rule` trust shim). Once we add the
//! external-egglog dep we'll consume real proof DAGs from upstream and
//! this AST stays small for hand-written fixtures and tests.
