//! A trait for reasoning in first-order **Peano arithmetic** (PA).
//!
//! [`Peano`] is the abstract interface of "doing a PA proof". It is
//! generic over three representations, the associated types
//! [`Term`](Peano::Term) / [`Prop`](Peano::Prop) /
//! [`Proof`](Peano::Proof) — and that genericity is the whole point.
//!
//! ## Three layers: expression theory, first-order logic, proofs
//!
//! PA is **first-order logic over an arithmetic expression theory**, and
//! the trait keeps those layers visible:
//!
//! - **Expression theory** ([`Term`](Peano::Term)) — the `nat`-sorted
//!   term language: `0`, successor, `+`, `*`, variables.
//! - **First-order logic** ([`Prop`](Peano::Prop)) — formulas built from
//!   the one relation symbol `=` ([`eq`](Peano::eq)) by the connectives
//!   ([`not`](Peano::not) / [`and`](Peano::and) / [`or`](Peano::or) /
//!   [`implies`](Peano::implies) / [`iff`](Peano::iff)) and quantifiers
//!   ([`forall`](Peano::forall) / [`exists`](Peano::exists)) over term
//!   variables. This layer is *not* arithmetic-specific — it is the FOL
//!   scaffolding. Eventually it will be factored into a generic
//!   `FirstOrder<Expr>` framework that **wraps any expression theory in
//!   first-order logic**; PA is then `FirstOrder<arithmetic>` plus the
//!   six arithmetic axioms.
//! - **Proofs** ([`Proof`](Peano::Proof)) — the PA axioms (as proofs),
//!   a full classical natural-deduction system over the FOL layer
//!   (assumption, the connective intro/elim rules, excluded middle,
//!   ∀/∃ generalize/specialize/intro/elim), and the [`induct`](Peano::induct)
//!   schema that makes the theory *Peano* arithmetic;
//!   [`concl`](Peano::concl) reads back the `Prop` a proof establishes.
//!
//! ## Two implementations, one API (the mirror principle)
//!
//! 1. **Shallow** — [`crate::init::nat::Hol`]: a PA term *is* the HOL
//!    `nat` term and a PA proof *is* a HOL [`Thm`](covalence_core::Thm)
//!    about `nat`. PA reasoning collapses to HOL reasoning. This is the
//!    "trivial" implementation — it exists today.
//! 2. **Deep** (future) — a syntactic `PaTerm` / `PaDerivation` AST.
//!    `Proof = PaDerivation`: the methods *build proof objects* you can
//!    serialise, hash, and transport, rather than HOL theorems.
//!
//! Because both implement the *same* trait, a generic routine written
//! against [`Peano`] runs against either. The bridge between them is a
//! **soundness** map `PaDerivation → Thm` — "every PA derivation
//! denotes a valid HOL theorem" — which is Covalence's first piece of
//! *symbolic metatheory*: PA as an object logic with HOL as the
//! metalogic (see `docs/VISION.md` §2).
//!
//! ## Status of the axioms
//!
//! In the shallow impl **every** PA axiom is now a genuine
//! hypothesis-free HOL theorem: induction and the freeness axioms via
//! kernel primitives, and the four `add`/`mul` recursion equations via
//! the recursion theorem ([`crate::init::recursion`], which discharged
//! the last postulate). So a shallow PA proof is an outright HOL
//! theorem — PA is sound in HOL with nothing assumed.
