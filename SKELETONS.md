# Skeletons

Authoritative registry of intentional placeholders in the repo: empty/stub
modules, removed-pending-rewrite subsystems, `NotImplemented` / `todo!()` /
`unimplemented!()` stubs, and tests that are commented out, `#[ignore]`d, or
deleted "for later".

See `CLAUDE.md` § Skeletons for the rules: **add an entry whenever you leave a
skeleton; delete the entry when you fill one in.** Keep this list complete —
it is how unfinished work stays discoverable.

## Empty / stub modules

- **`crates/covalence-kernel/src/facts.rs`** — empty module. The *observer*
  layer that records and content-addresses proven `covalence-hol` theorems
  will land here as the HOL-on-store stack comes online. See the
  `covalence-kernel` crate-root docs and `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Partial subsystems

- **`covalence-alethe` rule coverage.** `HolAletheBridge` (in
  `crates/covalence-alethe/src/hol.rs`) checks the QF_UF core (`assume`,
  `resolution` / `th_resolution`, `refl`, `trans`, `symm`, `cong`,
  `equiv_pos2`, `false`), the propositional family (`equiv1`, `equiv2`,
  `implies`, `and`, `and_intro`, `not_not`, `evaluate`,
  `equiv_simplify`), the integer term layer (`Int`, literals,
  `+ - * < <= > >=`), and `hole` / rewrite re-derivation by
  `reduce`+`simp`. The following return `BridgeError::NotImplemented` (or
  `UnknownRule`) and still need wiring:
  - **`hole` beyond closed arithmetic / propositional.** The recompute
    hook (`hol.rs::hole` → `normalize`) discharges a hole whose two sides
    share a `reduce`+`simp` normal form — closed `int` arithmetic
    (`1+2=3`), literal `=`, connective identities (`¬true=false`). A hole
    needing *variable-level ring normalisation* (`x+1 = 1+x`, distributes
    `*`) has no shared normal form yet → reported. Needs proved `int`
    ring identities (`add_comm`/`assoc`/`mul_distrib`) from the Peano/int
    theory + a linear normaliser. Likewise disequality-reflexivity holes
    over uninterpreted terms.
  - **Linear-arithmetic core** — `la_generic`, `la_mult_pos`/`la_mult_neg`,
    `la_rw_eq`, `la_disequality`, `la_tautology`, `la_totality`. The LIA
    proper: Farkas certificates over rational coefficients. Blocked on the
    **ordered-ring theory of `int`** (`le`/`lt` transitivity, add-
    monotonicity, sign rules) that the `high-hol` Peano build-up is
    producing. This is the major remaining undertaking.
  - **Subproofs** — `anchor` and any `step` carrying `:discharge`
    (`subproof`, `bind`, `let`, …). The bridge rejects `:discharge`.
  - **The rest of the propositional rule family** — `equiv_pos1`,
    `equiv_neg1`/`equiv_neg2`, `and_pos`/`and_neg`, `or`/`or_pos`/`or_neg`,
    `implies_pos`/`implies_neg`, `contraction`, `tautology`, `ite*`, plus
    the equality lemmas `eq_reflexive`/`eq_transitive`/`eq_symmetric`/
    `eq_congruent`. Each is a `clause_intro` of an intuitionistic sequent,
    a `simp`/`tauto`, or a direct equality derivation — the
    `init/logic.rs` machinery is in place; they just need cases in
    `hol.rs::step` (cf. the `equiv1`/`implies`/`and` cases already there).
  - **Parametric sorts** (`declare-sort` arity > 0) — rejected with
    `ParametricSort`.

## Registry maintenance

- **`SKELETONS.md` itself is incomplete.** This file was created to fix the
  missing `facts` module and currently records only the `covalence-kernel`
  skeletons surfaced there. It still needs a full repo audit — empty/stub
  modules, `todo!()` / `unimplemented!()` / `NotImplemented` stubs, and
  disabled / deleted tests across all crates — to become the authoritative
  registry `CLAUDE.md` describes.

## Removed-pending-rewrite subsystems

- **`covalence-kernel` legacy prover** — the arena + e-graph + union-find
  prover kernel that used to live in `covalence-kernel` was removed in the
  kernel rewrite. What remains is the content-addressed store wiring
  (`backend.rs`, `store.rs`) plus the empty `facts` module above. Recover the
  old prover from the `backup/pre-hol-cleanup` branch if needed.
