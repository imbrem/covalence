# Skeletons — covalence-core

## Declaration-only catalogue ops (no definitional body yet)

These `covalence-core` `defs/` term-specs carry `tm = None`: they are **sound
and complete on literals** (reduced by `builtins.rs`) but have no open-form
definitional body, so nothing about them is provable by `unfold_term_spec`.
Each should become a `let_term!` / `spec_term!` definition (see
`docs/roadmap.md`). When you add a body, delete it here AND — if the body is
reducible — add it to the `audit_reduce.rs::audit_reduce_matches_body`
coupling guard.

- **`sN.shr` (arithmetic right shift), `crates/covalence-core/src/defs/int_ops.rs`**
  — `op_body` returns `None` for the *signed* `Shr`. Needs a floor-division
  (round toward −∞), which `int` does not yet expose (`int.div` truncates
  toward zero). The *unsigned* `uN.shr` and every other `uN`/`sN` op
  (add/sub/mul/neg/and/or/xor/not/lt/le/gt/ge/shl/div/rem) are now defined.
- **`nat` ops, `crates/covalence-core/src/defs/nat.rs`** — `natBitAnd/Or/Xor`,
  `natToBytesLe/Be`, `natFromBytesLe/Be` are `term_decl!`
  (declaration-only). (`natDiv` now carries a def-style Euclidean selector
  predicate; it is not let-style, so its `builtins` reduction is checked
  against the predicate by `nat_div_mod_satisfy_euclidean_law` rather than
  the unfold-based `audit_reduce_matches_body` coupling guard.)
- **`bytes` ops, `crates/covalence-core/src/defs/blob.rs`** — `bytesConsNat`,
  `bytesAt` are declaration-only (need a `nat ↔ u8` conversion).
- **Fixed-width conversions** (`toNat`/`toInt`/`fromNat`/`fromInt`/`zext`/
  `sext`, `int_ops.rs`) are **intentionally** declaration-only — the
  primitive reducible interface the ops above are built on, not a stub.
