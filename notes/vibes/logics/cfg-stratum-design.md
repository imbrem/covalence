# CFG stratum — design (SpecTec grammars → Derives in HOL-omega)

Status: accepted design, implementation in progress on branch `spectec-grammar-cfg`.
Fills the "CFG stratum (headline next step)" entry of
`crates/kernel/hol/init/src/grammar/spectec/SKELETONS.md`. Companion to
[wasm-spec.md](./wasm-spec.md) (the SpecTec front end overall). Produced by a
three-design judge panel; the losing designs' verified corpus probes are folded
in below.

## Wrap-up status (2026-07-14) — what's built vs. designed-not-built

**Built + green** (M0–M6, this branch): the neutral CFG IR, the binary metalogic
engine, `GrammarEnv`/`Derives_E` + family soundness + the two-phase parsing
tactic, the SpecTec→`Cfg<u8>` lowering (under-approx `lower()` + recognition-mode
`lower_recognition()`), and **LEB128 *recognition*** — `⊢ Derives_E ⌜Bu32⌝ w` on
real WASM varints, `*idx` family unlocked, cross-checked vs the `leb128_regex`
oracle (`tests/cfg_grammar.rs`).

**Designed, not yet built** (was mid-flight at wrap-up):

- **LEB128 *value* decode** — `leb128_decode : list u8 → nat` + a round-trip
  theorem (atoms.md's "binary: LEB128"). ORTHOGONAL to the recognition work;
  belongs on `init::nat_binary`/`nat_bits_iso` (LSB-group-first 7-bit fold),
  ultimately in a `covalence-numerals` crate per
  [`../kernel/literals/numeral-literals-api.md`](../kernel/literals/numeral-literals-api.md).
- **The layered trait API** (maintainer directive): high-level SpecTec-shaped
  APIs implemented by traits, delegating down to a reusable mid-level, bottoming
  out at HOL-omega, so low-level rewrites don't disturb high-level callers. The
  mid-level should align with the K work's shared **term-rewrite relation in
  `metalogic::rewrite`** (see the K API-layering memory / K vision note) rather
  than diverging. A design workflow (4-probe understand → 2 proposals → judge
  synthesis) was in progress and was stopped for this wrap-up; re-run or resume
  `wasm-layered-api-design` to produce the final layer stack + first slice.
- **Full WASM parse**: value-coupled `ListN` vectors (need a value-producing
  parser, not just a recognizer), grammar-valued params (`Blist`/`Bsection_`
  `BX`), `Bname` utf8, sections, `Bmodule`.
- **Spec ingestion + version lattice**: relations/typing/reduction (`wasm/relation`),
  `Dec` metafunctions, the WASM 1.0/2.0 dumps (validated, staged in
  `~/tmp/spectec-dumps`, not embedded) + `1.0 ⊆ 2.0 ⊆ 3.0` env-transport
  metatheorems (see §"Version lattice" below).

Zero TCB growth: everything here is init-layer / lib-crate untrusted driver
code; the kernel re-checks every construction. Lowering bugs cost
faithfulness/completeness, never soundness.

## Corpus facts (measured against the bundled WASM 3.0 dump — SKELETONS claims were stale)

- `wasm_spec_ast` exposes ~231 grammars: ~89 `B*` binary + ~142 `T*` text —
  the **complete** binary format `Bmagic..Bmodule` (`Binstr`: 498 productions).
  The old "only a handful of B* grammars" claim is wrong; fix it where it
  appears. Pin exact counts in tests **from the parser's output**, not prose.
- The dominant bridge failure is `Attr` (value capture wrapping nearly every
  non-terminal ref), *not* `Var`. Bare-`Var` grammars: `Bcustom`, `Bcustomsec`,
  `Bmodule`, `Bsym`.
- **11 of 89** B* grammars carry production premises (`prs ≠ ∅`): `Bmodule`(3),
  `BuN`(2), `BsN`(3), `Bname`(1), `Bheaptype`(1: the `Bs33` branch),
  `Bsection_`(1), `Bblocktype`, `Bmemarg`, `Btable`, `Bfunc`, `Bcode`. The
  earlier "prs empty across sampled grammars" note was sampling error.
- Parametric grammars: `BuN/BsN/BiN/BfN` (bit-width arg; `Bu32` = `BuN(32)`;
  recursive arg `N−7` terminates at 4), `Blist` (type param + grammar-valued
  param `BX`, iterated `ListN` times — the length-prefixed-vector idiom,
  context-sensitive, beyond CFG), `Bsection_` (3 params).
- The B* corpus is left-recursion-free (byte formats are prefix-coded). Pin as
  a test.
- Verified demo chain: `Breftype` productions are
  `[0x63]·Bheaptype | [0x64]·Bheaptype | Babsheaptype`; `Bheaptype[0]` →
  `Babsheaptype` is premise-free; `0x70 ∈ Babsheaptype` (range 0x69–0x74). So
  `[0x70]` parses via one `Var` hop and `[0x64,0x70]` via the two-hop
  `Breftype→Bheaptype→Babsheaptype` chain.

## Decisions

### 1. Substrate: binary metalogic engine, grammar reified as its clause set

`metalogic::binary::RuleSet2 { nt_ty: nat, word_ty: list u8, clauses }` — a
thin (~120 LoC) binary generalisation of `metalogic::RuleSet`, reusing
`conj`/`nth_conjunct`/`conj_thms` verbatim. Judgement per grammar env E:

```
Derives_E n w := ∀d : nat → list u8 → bool. Closed_E d ⟹ d n w
```

exactly `init/regex`'s `Matches` shape, data-driven from a grammar env the way
`wasm/relation.rs` is data-driven from the spec. Non-terminal tags are **nat
literals** (`mk_nat i` per env index) — literals, not uninterpreted free vars,
so a concrete soundness family `F : nat → set (list u8)` can distinguish tags;
names live only in the Rust symbol table (names = efficiency, never soundness).

A production `NT → σ₁…σₖ` lowers to the first-order clause
`∀w₁…wₖ. A₁ ⟹ … ⟹ Aₖ ⟹ d ⌜nt⌝ (cat w₁ (cat w₂ …))` where terminal segments
give **side antecedents** `Aⱼ = Matches ⌜cⱼ⌝ wⱼ` (embedding the existing
reified `regex u8` terms, fold tvar `'r` left free — existing `prove_matches`
theorems plug in as leaf premises with zero coercion) and non-terminal segments
give `Aⱼ = d ⌜ntⱼ⌝ wⱼ`. All clauses are first-order: the β-capture wall does
not bite.

**SKELETONS amendment (deliberate):** the entry asked for an
"impredicative-encoded reified CFG datatype". The grammar is instead reified
*as its clause set* — `Closed_E` literally quotes every production inside every
`Derives_E` proposition — the same representation decision as prop/PA/Metamath
databases/wasm relations. First-class grammar *values*
(`Derives g nt w` with `g : set (prod nat (list sym))`, one grammar-independent
4-clause rule set, single polymorphic `Models`-discharge) are the recorded
upgrade path once a consumer (grammar-transformation metatheorems, env
transport) exists; the concrete recipe is `metalogic::database`'s
`db_rule_set` + `monotone`.

### 2. Grammar environment: per-env, dependency-closed

`GrammarEnv` (in `init/grammar/cfg`) is built from a neutral
`covalence_grammar::cfg::Cfg<u8>`; assigns dense nat tags, lowers productions
in fixed order, yields one `RuleSet2`. All non-terminals share one `d`, so
mutual recursion, `Rec` groups, and cross-grammar `Var` refs compose for free
(the `tag`-mixing move of `spec_rule_set`). Envs are built as the dependency
closure of root instances (e.g. `{Breftype}`) — never Binstr-scale for demos;
whole-corpus lowering exists only for the coverage *report*. The env caches
the assumed `Closed_E` Thm and per-clause metadata (word-var order = `all_elim`
order). Env-inclusion transport is future work.

### 3. Soundness: discharge-free family least-fixpoint package (lands early)

CFG languages are least fixpoints with no fold denotation, so the headline is
the rule-induction package, stated over an explicit language-family variable:

```
S1 (family_soundness):
⊢ ∀F : nat → set (list u8). ClosedFam_E F ⟹ ∀n w. Derives_E n w ⟹ mem w (F n)
```

where `ClosedFam_E F` is `Closed_E` at `d := λn w. mem w (F n)` with exactly
the two outer β-redexes per `d`-occurrence reduced (audited helper; normal form
pinned by test; `Matches` antecedents and denotation folds never touched).
Derivation: assume, `all_elim` at the predicate, `beta_nf`-bridge, intro —
milliseconds, **independent of grammar size**: no clause is ever discharged,
they ride inside the assumed `ClosedFam`. This kills the per-grammar Closed-D
perf wall by construction.

Vacuity guards: **S0** — concrete trivial family `F_triv := λn. {w | true}`
with `⊢ ClosedFam_E F_triv`. **S3** — regular-fragment agreement on Var-free
envs: family `F_reg` maps tag i to `⟦⌜rᵢ⌝⟧`; per-clause discharge = regex
soundness moves; yields `⊢ Derives_E ⌜i⌝ w ⟹ mem w ⟦⌜rᵢ⌝⟧`. S3's discharge is
per-env (can't reuse regex's polymorphic cache) — run only on tiny envs,
slow tests `#[ignore]`d. **S2** (staged later): comprehension family
`L_E := λn. {w | Derives_E n w}` is E-closed and least — the full fixpoint
characterisation.

### 4. Lowering pipeline (SpecTec-specific bits stay out of the kernel crate)

- `covalence_grammar::cfg` (**`crates/lang/grammar`** — the existing crate):
  neutral IR `Cfg<T> { nts, prods }`, `Seg = Term(Regex<T>) | NonTerm(NtId)`;
  validation, nullable + left-recursion analysis, independent `naive_parse`
  test oracle. SpecTec-agnostic — the K-framework work targets this directly.
- `covalence_spectec::cfg` (`crates/lib/wasm/spectec`): SpecTec `Grammar` →
  `Cfg<u8>`. (a) **Attr-stripping** — `Attr{e,g1} ↦ g1`, counted in the
  report. Honesty: stripping a *fresh-variable capture* is language-preserving;
  a *parameter-equality* attr (e.g. `Bsection_`'s id byte `N:Bbyte` with `N`
  bound) is a constraint, and stripping it over-approximates — classify the
  two cases, strip only captures silently, count constraint-attrs as
  `approximated` (none occur in premise-free non-parametric grammars, so v1 is
  unaffected; the monomorphiser later constant-folds ground parameter-equality
  attrs into literal byte terminals). (b) Maximal Var-free subtrees →
  `sym_to_regex_u8` → `Seg::Term`; `Var` → `Seg::NonTerm`. (c) `Alt` containing
  a Var distributes into multiple productions. (d) `Iter{g,List/List1/Opt}`
  over Var-containing g desugars via synthetic non-terminals
  (`X* ⇒ Xs → ε | X Xs` etc.) — unlocks `Bcustom`'s body. (e) `Var{x,as1}`
  with args ⇒ monomorphisation by const-folded instance key (staged, M6).
  (f) `ListN` ⇒ skip+report (context-sensitive; over-approx `listn_as_list`
  mode is recorded future work, off by default). (g) **`prs ≠ ∅` ⇒
  skip+report** (11 grammars — see census above). Skip granularity =
  production; typed `CfgLowerError`; `CfgReport` mirrors `LoweringReport` with
  per-grammar full/partial/none classification and ratcheted coverage counts.
  **Invariant (direction matters): every lowering is an under-approximation —
  `L(lowered Cfg) ⊆ L(SpecTec grammar)` — so `⊢ Derives_E` theorems imply
  membership in the true spec language.** No premise-drop over-approx mode in
  v1.
- `covalence-init/src/grammar/cfg` consumes only `Cfg<u8>`.

### 5. Recognizer/tactic: two-phase, copied from grammar/regex

Memoised top-down recognizer over `(NodeRef, lo, hi)` (NodeRef = regex Core ptr
or NtId), split enumeration as `CoreKind::Seq`; in-progress set as
belt-and-braces against left recursion (corpus has none, analysis flags it).
→ `CfgPlan` → single builder pass, zero failed kernel calls. Terminal segments
get `⊢ Matches ⌜cⱼ⌝ wⱼ` from the existing regex tactic; non-terminal segments
recurse. Generic application `derive_mixed(rs2, clause_idx, word_args,
premises)` with `Premise::Side(Thm)` vs `Premise::Derivation(Thm)` lives in
`metalogic::binary` (wasm/relation can later reuse it for if-premises).
Public: `GrammarEnv::prove_derives(nt, bytes) → ⊢ Derives_E ⌜nt⌝ w`
(hypothesis-free), `prove_in_every_family` chaining S1. Words stay rule-shaped
cat/cons trees (flattening deferred; oracle tests compare flattened bytes).

## North star (v1, all hypothesis-free, real dump + real bytes)

- T1: `⊢ Derives_{E_pre} ⌜Bmagic⌝ ⌜[0x00,0x61,0x73,0x6D]⌝` and `Bversion` on
  `[0x01,0,0,0]` — the real WASM preamble.
- T2 (headline): `⊢ Derives_{E_ref} ⌜Breftype⌝ ⌜[0x64,0x70]⌝` — three clause
  applications across three grammars, `0x70` leaf via a regex `Matches`
  theorem; plus the one-hop `[0x70]` variant. (`Bheaptype` lowers *partially* —
  its `Bs33` branch is premise-skipped — which the chain doesn't need.)
- T3: S1+T2 → `⊢ ∀F. ClosedFam_{E_ref} F ⟹ mem w (F ⌜Breftype⌝)` — the bytes
  lie in every language family closed under the WASM reftype rules.
- Coverage report over all B* grammars with ratcheted counts (pinned from
  parser output). Honest ratchet: fully-regular grammars + `Bsym` lower fully;
  `Bcustom` lowers as a grammar but its closure needs `Bname` (premise) —
  stretch, not promise. `Bmodule` needs premises+params: out of v1 scope.

## Milestones

M0 neutral IR (`covalence_grammar::cfg`) → M1 `metalogic/binary.rs` +
`GrammarEnv` + toy derives + S0 → M2 tactic (anbn + mutual-recursion toys,
differential vs `naive_parse`) → M3 S1 + normal-form pin + toy S3 → M4 SpecTec
lowering + census/ratchet tests + stale-SKELETONS fixes → M5 north-star demo +
wiring + docs. M6 stretch: monomorphisation (`BuN` chain), S2, `Bname`/
`Bcustom` if reachable. Every milestone lands with green `cargo test`.

## M6 — Missing grammars: LEB128 + recognition mode (added 2026-07-14, maintainer direction)

M0–M5 landed (all committed, green). The lowering `lower()` UNDER-approximates
and *skips* parametric (`BuN`/`BsN`/`BiN`/`BfN`, `Blist`, `Bsection_`),
premise-carrying (11 grammars), and `ListN` productions. The user wants "all the
missing grammars — in particular LEB128". This milestone adds a second,
opt-in **recognition mode** (`lower_recognition` / `LowerMode::Recognition`;
`lower()` stays `Under`) that unlocks them. Verified corpus facts from the probe:

- **LEB128 = `BuN`/`BsN`.** `BuN(N)` has two productions, *both* starting with a
  full-range `Bbyte`; the high-bit continuation/terminator split lives ONLY in
  the premises (`n<2^7` terminator vs `n≥2^7` continuation), and it self-recurses
  as `BuN(N−7)` guarded by `N>7` (terminates: 32→25→18→11→4). So the recognition
  byte-language of `BuN(N)` is exactly the repo's existing regex
  `covalence_spectec::grammar::simple::leb128_unsigned` = `[\x80-\xFF]*[\x00-\x7F]`,
  bounded to `ceil(N/7)` bytes. `crate::grammar::regex::tactic::prove_matches`
  already proves this hypothesis-free (tested: `[0x80,0x01]`→Some, `[0x80]`→None)
  — it is the differential oracle.

**Decisions.**

1. **LEB128 lowers to a single regex terminal, not byte-by-byte.** The CFG
   stratum embeds reified `regex u8` terms as terminal `Matches` side-antecedents
   (§1), so `BuN@N`/`BsN@N` lower to one production `Seg::Term(r)` where `r` is
   the **byte-count-bounded** LEB128 regex `[\x80-\xFF]{0,ceil(N/7)−1}[\x00-\x7F]`
   (exact on byte count; the only over-approximation is the top bits of the final
   byte — the irreducible "recognition vs value" gap). `prove_matches` supplies
   the leaf premise with zero coercion. Cheaper and more precise than unrolling.

2. **Monomorphiser** (general): thread a param-binding env
   `BTreeMap<&str,i64>` through `segment_alts`/`segment_item`/`lower_prod`; a
   `fold_exp(env,e) -> Option<i64>` const-folds the `Num`/`Bin(Add,Sub,Mul,Pow)`/
   `Cvt`(identity)/`Var`(env) fragment. A param-dependent `Var{x,as1}` whose args
   fold to ground values instantiates `x` at those values into a **deduped
   per-instance NT** (`mono: BTreeMap<(String,Vec<i64>),NtId>`, name `"BuN@32"`),
   lowering the target's productions under the pushed binding. Termination via the
   cache + the param-guard premises (below). This subsumes the existing narrow
   "param-independent ref" exception. `BfN(N)` → `N/8` literal `Bbyte` segments
   (fixed count, exact). Wrapper chains (`Bu32`=`BuN(32)`, `*idx`) fall out.

3. **Premise classification** (recognition mode; replaces blanket premise-drop):
   - **param-only premises** (mention only grammar params, e.g. `N>7`): evaluate
     with the instance binding; if false, DROP that production for this instance
     — *exact* (the production genuinely can't fire), and this is what bounds the
     `BuN` recursion.
   - **input-value premises** (mention captured production-local values, e.g.
     `n<2^N`): DROP — *over-approximate* (accept over-long/over-large encodings),
     counted as `premises_dropped`. For the LEB128-as-regex path these are
     subsumed by the regex, so the byte-range split need not be folded explicitly.
4. **`ListN` widening** → `desugar_star` (star, since WASM vectors can be empty)
   — over-approximate, counted `listns_widened`. `IterWithDom` likewise.
5. **Grammar-valued params** (`Blist`/`Bsection_` `BX`) — substitute the arg
   grammar; the first cut may defer these with honest reporting (they also carry
   `ListN` + parameter-equality attrs). Not on the LEB128 critical path.

**Honesty / invariant flip.** Recognition mode's per-production transformations
over-approximate, flipping toward `L(SpecTec) ⊆ L(Cfg)` (a *recognizer*:
soundness of rejection), the REVERSE of `lower()`'s `L(Cfg) ⊆ L(SpecTec)`
(membership witness). **But it is per-grammar, gated on `Full` coverage:**
recognition mode still *drops* productions it can't lower (unclassifiable
premise, monomorphisation depth cap, grammar-valued param), and a dropped
production under-approximates. So the clean `L(SpecTec) ⊆ L(Cfg)` holds only for
`Full`-coverage grammars (`Bu32`, the `*idx` family, the LEB128 chain — the
LEB128 targets are all `Full`); a `Partial` grammar mixes both directions and
its report coverage must be consulted before reading a `Derives_E` as a
recognizer. The kernel theorem is always exact regardless: `⊢ Derives_E ⌜nt⌝ w`
means precisely `w ∈ L(lowered Cfg)`. This must be an explicit opt-in: new `CfgReport` counters (`premises_dropped`, `listns_widened`,
`mono_instances`) mirror `attrs_constrained`; the module docstring + this note
state the flip; a *separate* recognition-mode ratchet test pins the new coverage
(don't mutate the under-approx ratchet). Kernel `Derives_E` theorems over a
recognition-mode env mean "these bytes are a well-formed *recognition* of the
grammar," not "these bytes encode an in-range value."

**North star (M6).** `⊢ Derives_E ⌜Bu32⌝ w` for real LEB128 varints (e.g.
`[0x80,0x01]`=128, `[0xE5,0x8E,0x26]`=624485), hypothesis-free, cross-checked
byte-for-byte against the `prove_matches(leb128_unsigned,·)` oracle; plus the
recognition-mode coverage jump (BuN/BsN/BiN/BfN, Bu32/Bu64, all `*idx` leave the
skip buckets). The **value-decode** atom (`leb128_decode : list u8 → nat` + a
round-trip theorem, atoms.md's "binary: LEB128") is a *separate, orthogonal*
deliverable on `nat_binary`/`nat_bits_iso` under the future `covalence-numerals`
crate — recognition and value-decode meet only at the regex oracle; do not
conflate them.

## M8 — Whole-module recognition: grammar-valued monomorphisation (landed 2026-07-17)

The recognition-mode monomorphiser's keys now extend beyond `Vec<i64>`: an
instance key is `(name, Vec<InstArg>)` with `InstArg = Int(i64) | Gram(NtId) |
Typ(rendered)`. A grammar-valued argument (`Blist`/`Bsection_`'s `BX`) resolves
to a non-terminal — a plain grammar, a pass-through of an enclosing `Gram`
param, or a *recursively* monomorphised nested instance (`Btypesec` ⇒
`Bsection_@1,type,Blist@type,Btype`). `Typ` args never reach the byte level but
stay in the key conservatively. The pre-mint-then-lower cache order makes
same-key self-references close on the cache; `MAX_INST_DEPTH` stays the
belt-and-braces cap. Three companion moves:

1. **Parameter-equality attr fold** (recognition-only): `[e]:Bbyte` with `e`
   const-folding under the instance binding (through `Case`/`Tup` wrappers)
   lowers to the literal byte — **exact**, this is `Bsection_`'s section-id
   byte (the fold the Attr-classification section below anticipated). Not
   applied to `Bu32`-typed constants (multiple LEB encodings — folding would
   under-approximate).
2. **Iterated value premises**: `Iter`-wrapped `if`s over production-locals
   (`Bmodule`'s data-count / func-code correlation) drop like plain input-value
   premises, counted. Param-only iterated bodies still skip (unevaluable
   without the value-level dom).
3. **Per-NT production index + pure terminal probes** in the parsing tactic
   (`grammar/cfg/tactic.rs` + `regex::tactic::recognizes_core`): the search
   phase does zero kernel calls and no longer scans the whole clause list per
   goal — necessary at whole-spec scale.

**Result (measured, pinned):** B\* recognition coverage 60/7/22 → **84 Full /
3 Partial (`BuN` `BsN` `Bsection_`, open-param generics) / 2 None (`BiN`
`Blist`, ditto)**; whole-231 recognition 1185 prods/1372 clauses/316 NTs/246
skips → **1221/1526/385/210**. `Bmodule` + all 14 section grammars + the
`Blist`-chain leaves (`Bfunc Bcode Bdata Belem Bname Bresulttype`) lower Full.
**T5 (`tests/cfg_grammar.rs`): a real 27-byte module —
`(module (func (result i32) i32.const 42))` — proves
`⊢ Derives_E ⌜Bmodule⌝ ⌜bytes⌝` hypothesis-free**, with recognition-refusal on
corrupt magic / invalid section id, and T5b re-proves it on the whole-spec
1526-clause env with an honest `derives_meaning = Mixed` classification.

**Honesty (pinned in T5 + `bmodule_recognition_differential`):** recognition
`Bmodule` has two byte *sinks* beyond the familiar per-production widenings —
(a) star-widened vectors + dropped `len` premises let a widened index star
swallow trailing low-LEB bytes (truncating the final `end` still derives);
(b) `Bcustom` ends in `byte*`, so a parse may re-split to open a custom
section at any reachable `0x00` and swallow arbitrary garbage (dangling `0x80`
still derives). Refusal is still sound (`L(SpecTec) ⊆ L(Cfg)` per Full
grammar); derivability ≠ validity. Exact Under-mode `Bmodule` = the
value-coupled `ListN` + faithful-`len` story. Also new: the recognition corpus
has *nullable-body star* left-recursion (`Bcustomsec*` — `Bcustomsec` is
genuinely nullable via `Bsection_`'s ε), which the tactic's in-progress guard
handles without completeness loss (ε-contributions of a star are droppable).
Whole-module proofs need the relation leg's 64 MiB
`with_total_stack` (deep structural recursion over the ~800–1500-clause
`Closed_E` conjunction) and tens of seconds each in debug — same scale risk,
same recorded escape hatches (iterative kernel walks / arena).

Residue: the 66 `T*_` context-param grammars (context-valued `Exp` args never
const-fold; text format stays dead), `rule`/`let` premises (4 prods), 2 bridge
terminals — see the two SKELETONS files.

## Version lattice + metatheorems (added 2026-07-13, maintainer direction)

Requirements: WASM **1.0 and 2.0** alongside 3.0, plus arbitrary *subsets* of
WASM; and version-inclusion **metatheorems** — WASM 1.0 ⊆ 2.0 ⊆ 3.0 both
syntactically and semantically — as the flagship test of the machinery.

1. **Env transport is promoted from "future work" to a planned milestone
   (M7).** The clause-set representation already supports it with no new
   kernel machinery: to prove `⊢ ∀n w. Derives_E n w ⟹ Derives_E' (ρ n) w`
   (ρ = Rust-computed tag remapping, aligning non-terminals *by name* across
   envs since tags are per-env dense indices), run `rule_induction2` on E at
   `pred := λn w. Derives_E' (ρ n) w` and discharge each E clause with the
   matching E' derivation constructor (`derive_mixed`). Data-driven: a
   Rust-side matcher pairs each E production with an E' production (or a
   derivable composite); unmatched productions ⇒ skip+report, making the
   theorem an honest per-matched-fragment inclusion rather than a false
   blanket claim. Subgrammar-extraction envs get `Derives_sub ⟹ Derives_full`
   the same way — that is the "subsets of WASM" story.
2. **Semantic inclusion** rides the relation leg (`wasm/relation.rs`):
   `spec_rule_set` per version yields `Derivable_S_v`; inclusion by the same
   rule-induction-with-`pred := Derivable_S_v'` move on the unary engine.
   `encode.rs` is version-independent, so rules unchanged across versions
   encode to *identical* clauses (discharge is mechanical); reformulated rules
   (3.0 rewrote several judgement shapes) need per-rule bridge lemmas —
   matched/bridged/unmatched reported, never silently claimed.
3. **Honesty caveat:** the versions are not literal rule-for-rule supersets;
   the deliverable is "inclusion on the matched fragment + explicit residue
   report", tightening as bridge lemmas land. Grammar-side (binary format)
   inclusion is expected to be near-total; typing/reduction less so.
4. **Dumps (blocker resolved to a recipe, 2026-07-13):** upstream bundles only
   the 3.0 dump, but the dump backend is *upstream* SpecTec (`--ast` prints the
   elaborated IL as S-exprs; `spectec/src/backend-ast/` in WebAssembly/spec),

   (what `spectec_ast` 2.0's decoder tracks — do NOT use main, IL format
   drifts), build spectec (OCaml ≥5.1 + dune + menhir + zarith + mdx; pure-nix
   shell works, opam fallback), then from `specification/`:
   `../spectec/spectec wasm-1.0/* --ast > wasm-1.0.spectec-ast` (same for
   2.0); validate with `spectec_ast::parse_spectec_stream` before embedding in
   covalence-spectec (`grammar::wasm1/wasm2` next to `wasm3`). **Verified:
   `wasm-1.0/A-binary.spectec` and `wasm-2.0/A-binary.spectec` both define the
   full binary grammars** (Bvaltype…Bmodule; 2.0 incl. SIMD Binstr), and both
   versions ship full syntax/typing/reduction — so both metatheorem legs have
   data. Quirk: 1.0/2.0 spell the magic as literal bytes rather than a named
   `Bmagic` rule — don't key on grammar names across versions.
   **Executed 2026-07-13:** both dumps produced and validated (0 decode
   errors via `parse_spectec_stream`), staged at
   `~/tmp/spectec-dumps/wasm-{1.0,2.0}.spectec-ast` pending embedding:
   1.0 = 315 defs / 61 grams (sha256 4ee41611…), 2.0 = 467 defs / 71 grams
   (sha256 af2da767…); 3.0 bundled = 972 defs / 231 grams. Toolchain notes:
   `nix-shell -p ocaml dune_3 ocamlPackages.{findlib,zarith,menhir,menhirLib,mdx}`
   (plain `nix shell` misses findlib hooks), build with `dune build` (the
   Makefile's opam target fails), binary at
   `_build/default/src/exe-spectec/main.exe`.
5. Once cross-version metatheorems multiply, the grammar-as-value upgrade
   (§1: one `monotone` theorem via `metalogic::database`'s recipe instead of
   per-pair inductions) becomes the economical form — unchanged as the
   recorded end-state; per-pair transport first.

## Risks / mitigations (short)

Per-env S3 discharge cost → S1 is discharge-free, S3 tiny-env-only.
`Closed_E` size / linear `nth_conjunct` → dependency-scoped envs, cached
assumed-Closed, padded-env benchmark; balanced conjunction if needed later.
Cat-tree words → oracle flattens; normalisation is a SKELETONS residual.
Free-`'r` leakage → stay schematic everywhere, pin only at regex-soundness
projection; cross-plugging test in M2. β discipline → one audited ClosedFam
helper + pinned normal form. Attr semantics → capture/constraint split above.
