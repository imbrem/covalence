//! `close` and `quot` type constructors — both subtypes of the
//! powerset `base → bool`.
//!
//! - [`TypeSpec::close`] `base rel` is the type of **non-empty,
//!   `rel`-upward-closed subsets** of `base`. Dedekind cuts use it
//!   directly (`real := close rat (≤)`).
//! - [`TypeSpec::quot`] `base rel` is the **quotient** `base / rel`:
//!   its elements are exactly the `rel`-equivalence classes, each
//!   represented as the set of its members. The carving predicate is
//!   `λS. ∃z. S = (λy. rel z y)` — `S` is *exactly* one class
//!   (`classOf z`), nothing more. When `rel` is an equivalence relation
//!   those sets are precisely its equivalence classes, with no junk.
//!
//! Both bottom out in [`TypeSpec::subtype`] of `base → bool`.
//!
//! ## Why `quot` is not `close`
//!
//! An earlier version defined `quot = close ∘ symmetric-closure`, i.e.
//! the non-empty subsets upward-closed under `rel`. That is **wrong**:
//! for an equivalence `rel`, every *union* of classes (including the
//! whole carrier) is non-empty and upward-closed, so the type was full
//! of junk that is not a single class. Picking representatives off such
//! junk breaks quotient induction and makes identities like `a + 0 = a`
//! fail. The image predicate below admits a set iff it is `classOf z`
//! for some `z`, so there is exactly one inhabitant per class.
